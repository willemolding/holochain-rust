# Intro to Command Line Tools

It will likely not come as much of a surprise that to develop a Holochain app requires the use of the command line, or terminal, of your computer. 

Fortunately, there are a set of custom designed tools for working with Holochain that can be installed as utilities to your command line to simplify and accelerate the process of Holochain app development.

If you wish to be able to attempt what you are reading about, as you continue through the articles on building an app, you will need to first install these command line tools to your computer.

The command tools are accessible for installation from an online repository at [github.com/holochain/holochain-cmd](https://github.com/holochain/holochain-cmd). If you wish to install them, follow the link, and then follow the instructions in the README there for installation.

The README contains an overview of the different functions of the command line tools. You will also learn these organically just by proceeding through the other articles in this section. For example, how to use them to bootstrap a brand new project folder for your app.
